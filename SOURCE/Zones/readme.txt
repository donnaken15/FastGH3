default PAK contains fallback textures/images that standard GH3 zones do not have and are specific to this mod
this is done for compatibility of old zones, that is until the game crashes if it doesn't have necessary textures/materials like what GH3+ requires, or if old zones don't have new additions like open note particles or overlapping starpower gems, or even..... mines(????)
